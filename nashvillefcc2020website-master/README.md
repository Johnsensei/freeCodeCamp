Source code for our group's upcoming public Web site. Development primarily happens in the `/src` folder. We use Netlify to deploy and host the site.

## Built With

This project was bootstrapped with the Gatsby starter [gatsby-starter-tailwind](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/taylorbryant/gatsby-starter-tailwind/).

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

> "Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces." â€“[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

## Getting Started

From the command line, you can run:

- `npm install` - Installs dependencies for this project.
- `npm run develop` - Runs the site in development mode, allows for live editing.
- `npm run build` - Builds the site for deployment in `public` folder, which we ignore with git.
- `npm run analyze` - See what ESLint and Prettier can fix.
- `npm run fix` - Run Prettier and ESLint with the `--fix` option.
- `npm run test` - TODO: https://gatsby.dev/unit-testing\

If you are using VS Code, we have recommended extensions listed in the `free-code-camp-nashville.code-workspace` file. VS Code will automatically detect that list and prompt you to install.
